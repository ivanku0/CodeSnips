# CodeSnips
a place to store and track your code snippets!

## What is CodeSnips?
CodeSnips is my final project for my General Assembly Javascript course. The purpose of this tool is to allow new developers to track pieces of code snippets from their assignments/studies in a convenient place and to associate each snippet with helpful resource URLs

## How's the UI?
The interface is a simple two-paned view, with a list of user code snippets stored on the left, which can be searched and sorted. The right side will be the code snippet view, with an additional link to resources associated with each specific snippet.

## Features
CodeSnip users will be able to:
- Add code snippets with a title and description
- Edit or delete existing snippets
- Query for snippets
- Sort snippets by date, alphabetical order, or favorite status
- Add resources to each code snippet
- Edit existing resources

## Execution Plan
1. Create a functioning server
2. Generate a working data model for mongoose
3. Create models for code snippets and resources
4. Demonstrate functioning forms and CRUD
5. Create dynamic sorting for code snippets (date & favorite)
5. Create styling for code snippet views and reuse it for resources
6. Create functioning nav bar styling
7. Create split view under navbar
8. **IF POSSIBLE** Add user-authentication
